This repository contains my web application for my BSc Thesis: "Automatic Code Summarization Using Large Language Models". It consists of a python FastAPI and a simple frontend created
using basic HTML and CSS.

The application can not be ran without adding the checkpoints to the models in the models directory (Only deepseek 1.3B instruct and CodeT5 Base 220M can be added).

The checkpoints can be found here:
